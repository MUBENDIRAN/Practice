# Python DSA Practice

This repository contains my personal collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems practiced in Python, focusing on OOP principles.

## Topics Covered

### Data Structures (OOP based)
*   **Linked Lists**: Implementation, Cycle Detection/Removal, Reversal, Palindrome, Merging, and Nth element.
*   **Trees & BST**: Binary Tree, Level Order, BST (Insert, Search, Validate), LCA, Diameter, and Height.
*   **Stacks & Queues**: LRU Cache, Min Stack, Circular Queue, and Deques.

### Algorithms
*   **Sorting**: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick Sort.
*   **Searching**: Binary Search (Rotated, Infinite, Square Root).
*   **Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs, Buy/Sell Stock.
*   **Sliding Window**: Maximum Sum Subarray, Longest Substring, First Negative Integer.
*   **Two Pointers**: Two Sum, Move Zeros, Sorted Squares, Remove Duplicates.
*   **Miscellaneous**: Matrix Rotation, Spiral Print, Group Anagrams, and recursion problems.
